##### COMPILING #####
For compiling the project, just enter : ant
The project can also be compiled in debug mode with : ant debug

##### USING THE COMPILER #####
java -jar jar/Compiler.jar <file.c>

##### MAIN TEST #####
In order to launch a test, first you will need to run this script:
sh generate_tests.sh

This will generate the file: seperate_tests.sh. To start testing, you will need to run this script:
sh seperate_tests.sh


This will build the project and generate the assembly files corresponding to each C file contained in the directory tests/singular_tests and execute a series of tests, each corresponding to one of the C files (note that if a C file contains any errors, or is impossible to compile using MyGCC, it's assembly code will not be generated).
